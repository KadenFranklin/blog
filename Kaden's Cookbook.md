This one is going to be a little different. I intend to update this periodically. I want to share my favorite recipes and those which I have had the pleasure of learning from friends.

I'll also sharing a personal anecdote about where the recipe comes from or why I enjoy it.

# Brownies

####### Absolutely not stolen from an Instagram post

Ingredients:

    * 1 & 1/2 Cup Sweet potatoes
    * 1/2 Cup Almond Butter
    * 1/2 Cup Maple Syrup
    * 1 tbsp Oil
    * 1/4 Cup Cocoa
    * 1/4 Cup Almond Flour
    * 1/4 tsp baking soda
    * 1/4 tsp baking powder
    * 1 tsp vanilla
    * a pinch of salt
    * + chocolate chips

Process:

  * Mix all listed ingredients in a bowl, until smooth

  * then bake in a square pan (the most efficient kind) at 450° for ~1hr

  * (stick a toothpick in the middle, when the middle starts to harden its done)


# Sweet Potato Fries

####### My grandmother was raised on a sweet potato farm, she lived to be 92. I can only dream of existing that long

Ingredients:

    * Sweet potatoes
    * Cooking Oil (any kind)
    * Tony Chachere's (any spice level)

Process:

  * Chop the Sweet Potatoes, making the individual fries as skinny and long as possible.

  * After Chopping, spread the sweet potatoes on a baking pan as evenly as possible

  * Drizzle cooking oil over the sweet potatoes.

  * Sprinkle Tony Chachere's over the sweet potatoes.

        * You can also spread the oil, and Tony's in by mixing the ingredients up with your hands, it is just messy.

  * Place pan in oven at 450° for 1 hour.

    * After 30 mins, remove pan from oven, flip sweet potatoes, and sprinkle more Tony's on the sweet potatoes, and place back in the oven.


# Red Beans and Rice

####### My Mother thinks bacon grease is a family secret.

Ingredients:

    * 2 lbs red kidney beans (I like camellia's)

    * water

    * 1 chopped onion (easier to blend though)

    * 4 bay leaves

    * Bacon grease (2 tbsp)

    * 1 cup flour

    * Seasonings: Salt, Pepper, Parsley, Garlic Powder, Tony Chachere's, Paprika

    * Optional: Ham

Process:

  * Leave beans to soak in a pot overnight. (Your body won't be able to digest them otherwise)

  * In the morning drain the water, and replace it with twice as much water as you have beans.

  * Leave the beans on the stove on a low temp, with the 4 bay leaves in the pot for a few hours.

  * 1 - 1.5 hrs before serving add the onion, bacon grease, and seasonings (2 tbsp each) and potentially even ham.

  * Bring the pot to a boil for 10 minutes (stir constantly otherwise it will burn)

  * After the pot has finished boiling, return to low heat, and in a separate container mix about 1 cup of flour with water until it has a creamy consistency.

  * Mix this cup of flour-water into the pot, and the beans are ready to serve.
