This one is going to be a little different. I intend to update this periodically. I want to share my favorite recipes and those which I have had the pleasure of learning from friends. I'll also sharing a personal anecdote about where the recipe comes from or why I enjoy it.

# Brownies

####### Absoloutely not stolen from an instagram post

Ingredients:

    * 1 & 1/2 Cup Sweet potatoes
    * 1/2 Cup Almond Butter
    * 1/2 Cup Maple Syrup
    * 1 tbsp Oil
    * 1/4 Cup Cocoa
    * 1/4 Cup Almond Flour
    * 1/4 tsp baking soda
    * 1/4 tsp baking powder
    * 1 tsp vanilla
    * a pinch of salt
    * + chocolate chips


Process:

  * Mix all listed ingredients in a bowl, until smooth

  * then bake in a square pan (the most efficient kind) at 450° for ~1hr

  * (stick a toothpick in the middle, when the middle starts to harden its done)






# Sweet Potato Fries

####### My grandmother was raised on a sweet potato farm, she lived to be 92. I can only dream of existing that long

Ingredients:

    * Sweet potatoes
    * Cooking Oil (any kind)
    * Tony Chachere's (any spice level)

Process:

  * Chop the Sweet Potatoes, making the individual fries as skinny and long as possible.

  * After Chopping, spread the sweet potatoes on a baking pan as evenly as possible

  * Drizzle cooking oil over the sweet potatoes.

  * Sprinkle Tony Chachere's over the sweet potatoes.

        * You can also spread the oil, and Tony's in by mixing the ingredients up with your hands, it is just messy.

  * Place pan in oven at 450° for 1 hour.

    * After 30 mins, remove pan from oven, flip sweet potatoes, and sprinkle more Tony's on the sweet potatoes, and place back in the oven.

    * Enjoy
