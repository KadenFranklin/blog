Hello. You seem to have stumbled upon my blog.

My name is Kaden Franklin. I am a computer science student currently enrolled at Hendrix College. I am from New Orleans but I don't get to spend much time there anymore. I like my dog, I enjoy rock climbing, and I would like to backpack throughout Europe some day.

Here are some of my favorite things, if you're bored:
