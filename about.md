Hello. My name is Kaden Franklin. You seem to have stumbled upon my blog. I come here to periodically track progress on random projects, be sad, remind myself how to use html, or just talk about stuff I do that I think is cool.

I am a computer science student currently enrolled at Hendrix College. I am from New Orleans but I don't get to spend much time there anymore. I like my dog, I enjoy rock climbing, and I would like to backpack throughout Europe some day.

Here are some of my favorite things, if you're bored:
