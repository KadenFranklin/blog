In an attempt to make this blog a little more personal I am adding a page about my dog. (He's great)

  <!-- Some back story: -->

  <!-- I got Peter for my eighteenth birthday. My parents took me in the middle of the night to drive across state lines. I had no idea where we were going and I selected him from a breeder. He is in fact a pure Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Most Corgis have their tails docked at birth, but it is kind of actually just a cruel practice, so the breeder we went to simply did not do it. He is an energetic ball of fur and happiness. He has separation anxiety, which makes me very sad when I know I have to live away from him for a while. He has been the only source of comfort on my worst days, and my best friend on the better ones. In the summer of 2021 I lived on a farm and was able to take him with me for a couple months. He has never been as cheeky as when he was living with me there. He would always dash out the door, and he loves to splash water out of his bowl onto his stomach, and correspondingly the floor. He has calmed down since he came back from the farm, he is more well behaved now. I hope that as he gets older  But I dream of one day owning so much land I don't need to worry about how far he goes. -->
