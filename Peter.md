In an attempt to make this blog a little more personal I am adding a page about my dog.

  <!-- Some back story: -->

  <!-- I got Peter for my eighteenth birthday. My parents took me in the middle of the night to drive across state lines. I had no idea where we were going and I selected him from a breeder. He is in fact a pure Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Most Corgis have their tails docked at birth, but it is kind of actually just a cruel practice, so the breeder we went to simply did not do it. -->

Mostly just photo dumps from here on, enjoy.
