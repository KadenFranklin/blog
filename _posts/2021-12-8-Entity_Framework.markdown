Overall the tutorial was not that complicated it was simply long. It did not help that I waited so long to complete it... It had a lot of parts but most of it was copy paste. There were some parts that were confusing in the beginning. Dealing with multiple tables and implementing age for students were confusing in particular. The amount of things that need to be changed with multiple tables makes all the work feel tedious. But after completing this lab I feel confident in the database that we have for the arboretum website.
