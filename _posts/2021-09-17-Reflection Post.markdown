This lab did not take me as long as the previous one. I feel like both have given me a good grasp of how to work with a system like jekyll and websites that are set up in this manner. The only thing that took some considerable effort was getting other .md files to appear in the nav bar. (I accidentally edited index.md and that set me back for a minute.)

I do not believe there is much else to say about this lab. Thus I will leave you with some links that helped me complete this and some pictures of my dog peter.
