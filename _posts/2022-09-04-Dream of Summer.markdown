I've returned to Hendrix. I survived being homeless and a season of Trailwork! I enjoyed it as a job mostly because of the people I got to meet. I got asked by boy scouts if we were doing 'work release' which was one of the funniest things I ever experienced. Other than that I just did A ton of exploring and climbing. I did a lot of free soloing for the first time. That was fun but I reckon I'm going to do less of it.

I have a bunch of cool new projects I am going to be working on which is fun. I'm planning on making a few websites. Hoping I get really good at it. I am also going to be working on a [Watson] (https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj) proposal over the next month. In an ideal world where I receive the scholarship I'd be travelling internationally. I'd really like to work with the boy scouts and other international scouting organizations on trail design, and conservation. An emphasis on education and career pathways, but also fieldwork itself. But one can only dream so hard.



<!-- I'm now back on campus and I have an apartment which is nice, but I have to do paperwork all day, which is so boring. I'm glad to be back with my friends, but part of me just misses being alone and not having anyone to wait around on. idk i'm prob just too introspective as usual but I just find myself sitting in my apartment a lot of the time waiting for Isaac or Lane to come back home. The only other person I really hang out with frequently is Sam, and Jacks gone this semester so that has only been adding to my lonesomeness. IDK man, maybe I need to pick up a hobby like professional speedrunning, or playing bass, or computer programming. But otherwise parties have been fun when I get invited, or have something to do. -->
