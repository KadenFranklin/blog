I've returned to Hendrix. I survived being homeless and a season of Trailwork! I enjoyed it as a job mostly because of the people I got to meet. I got asked by boy scouts if we were doing 'work release' which was one of the funniest things I ever experienced. Other than that I just did A ton of exploring and climbing. I did a lot of free soloing for the first time. That was fun but I reckon I'm going to do less of it.

I have a bunch of cool new projects I am going to be working on which is fun. I'm planning on making a couple websites. Hoping I get really good at it. I am also going to be working on a [Watson](https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj) proposal over the next month. In an ideal world where I receive the scholarship I'd be travelling internationally. I'd really like to work with the boy scouts and other international scouting organizations on trail design, and conservation. An emphasis on education and career pathways, but also fieldwork itself. But one can only dream so hard.

Being back at Hendrix is nice and all. But there was something so simple about this summer and the type of work I was doing. It was like an extended vacation from thinking, and now I'm back here and all I get to do is think. I made a really close friend this summer. It is awful to think about now because I only got to spend two months with them, but we bonded so much, I've never beome such fast friends with someone in my life. We enjoyed a ton of the same hobbies, urban exploration, mishcief, and spontaneous adventures. I ended up staying on their couch for a couple months while we worked together on the trail. I don't think I've had such a fun summer in my life, it will be hard to top. And I don't know how I am going to keep myself stimulated without dirt to move.
