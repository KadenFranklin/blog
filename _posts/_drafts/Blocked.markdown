  <!-- I made a webpage to count the number of accounts i have blocked on twitter.

  I started Blocking corporate accounts pretty much as soon as I got the app. Twitter is a glorified message board, many apps just like it have come and gone, this one just became very popular. It was honestly very enjoyable to go on my own personal crusade and in some small way take back some part of my time. Once I got past ~3,000 blocked accounts I started getting very obscure ads. Ones from smaller businesses, and even adds that were in completely different languages. For a while it was enjoyable to not know what to expect to see in an ad, as it can get boring when all of your content is catered too.

  I don't really have a purpose for building this, I just thought it would be funny. I don't really use social media any more, and I am much more relaxed without it. But if I ever return to twitter to look at something, best believe I'm gonna block every corporate ad. It was fun to build the first part of this project, because I just used javascript and edited the DOM to get the animation to function. Getting the request to go through to the twitter API was kind of a hassle though. I didn't know what I was doing because I haven't built anything on the web in a while. It also didn't that I started building with jekyll, which was a bad idea. It took a lot of (4) other libraries to create the request for Twitter which made it so much fun to package and build into a webpage. I did this the same week that Twitter changed its name to X.com, so I was expecting to have to revisit this code at a later date. -->
