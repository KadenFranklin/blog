Here we go the first official post on my blog. My experience in setting up this blog was fairly easy. I think it is so easy, practically anyone could do it given the right instructions and guidance. All it really took was installing ruby and a couple things through the command prompt. I did accidentally skip a step. This left me without some of the critical sections of this blog that make it function as a real website.

After some time and assistance from my professor, I fixed my mistake and got this blog to its current state.
