Throughout the course of this semester I have been able to see what it is like to work on a team and build a website for a client. The ability to work with a community partner mimics the sort of relationship you could have with a potential boss in the future. The opportunity to bring your clients ideas to life through the website is spectacular and provides a sense of fulfillment. The real takeaway is that every group in this class is building something that effectively helps the community in some way, whether that be educational through a nonprofit, etc. It is a well known fact that programmers stand to profit a lot in this day and age. This class has given me a chance to see that it is important to give back to ones own community because we stand to gain so much.
