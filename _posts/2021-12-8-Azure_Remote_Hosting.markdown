For the most part I did not have a large stake in lab 9. I had fallen behind in te labs so by the time I was able to work on it the lab was done. I did end up having a third party host the images for our website. I went through many stressful processes trying to get something to work proper and ended up fine in the end. The finished repository for this lab can be found [HERE](https://github.com/qsebring3930/csci340lab9)
