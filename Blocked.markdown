  I intend for this to be like [SocialBlade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/youtube/realtime). That being a live counter for the amount of accounts I have blocked on twitter. I want it to update as often as possible with the limited amount of requests I have. (15 requests / 15 minutes)

  I don't really have a purpose for doing this. I think it would be fun to display the absurd amount of accounts I have blocked. And give me a justification for using an app as bad as twitter. I usually only block corporate accounts. I have a distinct hate for the ways in which they try to capture our attention. It seeps down into everything we enjoy and used only to gain more control over people nowadays. I also haven't done much work since I graduated and I would like to change that.
