I made it through another semester at HDX! Not like it is usually challenging but this previous one was particularly bad for me. I kinda sorta did some cool stuff for a final project, working with facial detection algorithms and pizza. It didn’t go the exact way I planned and if you know me, procrastinating is my favorite hobby. But I feel like I missed a shot to do something really fun. If you wanna look at it, its [here] (https://github.com/KadenFranklin/pizza_pasta). Maybe one day I’ll finish it completely far past the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah I am back home for a week and a half. I finally got around to fixing the css styling of this blog, it looks pretty swag if I do say so myself. I finally figured out how to do stuff under the hood of these jekyll.md files, so I am actually enjoying this blogging thing. The Arboretum is being diligently worked on by Dr. Goadrich and I am excited about the future for a change. I am going to Colorado for the summer. I am doing trail maintenance with MHYC in Denver. I may or may not be camping an unhealthy amount and or living out of my car. But I’m not really as scared as I think I should be. I feel like if anything I really want to do it. It is such a change from what is normally going on in my life I feel like it will be so good for me. I get to live in the mountains, high elevations means less dense air so I will come back home with the endurance of a greek god. But no, I am excited to just climb a bunch of rocks, smoke so much weed, and feel useful doing what I like to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna try to figure out how to upload a video on here, and maybe fill a webpage with images of variable size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t hold me to that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html">I did it. I made it through another semester at HDX!

It was a class project for CSCI 340, but my group ran into a bunch of problems. So I have kind of been working on it for way longer than I need to but that’s alright cause its hard for me to give up on things. I had versions of this project saved through its incremental development over the past months, and I thought it would be cool to leave a record of that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kadenfranklin.github.io/actually-a-map/Oldest/The%20Hendrix%20College%20Campus%20Arboretum%20_%20Hendrix%20College&quot;&gt;Oldest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There already existed a webpage for the Hendrix Arboretum but it was not interactive, or anything it just kinda explained what it was. I copied saved a version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hendrix.edu/biology/biology.aspx?id=3645&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;, and started looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/v8-web-control/map-control-api/&quot;&gt;bing maps api&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how the heck it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kadenfranklin.github.io/actually-a-map/Old/The%20Hendrix%20College%20Campus%20Arboretum%20_%20Hendrix%20College&quot;&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this the only real development was that I made it access the correct css files. Definitely took me way too long to figure this on out. For future reference, the difference between this and the first is ‘./’ preceding some files instead ‘..’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kadenfranklin.github.io/actually-a-map/Middle/The%20Hendrix%20College%20Campus%20Arboretum%20_%20Hendrix%20College&quot;&gt;Middle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed the css a little bit. Added a border around the map, added the search bar and made trees searchable by number I think. Also made buttons for specialty categories, but the buttons did not actually do anything in this version. There are trees on this map, but they are randomly generated, you can click them and see the infoboxes I made, their links and pictures do not work without the rest of the project though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kadenfranklin.github.io/actually-a-map/New/The%20Hendrix%20College%20Campus%20Arboretum%20_%20Hendrix%20College&quot;&gt;New&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first version of the map that was actually linked to the database. That is why you see the for each item in Model.specialties. It also read tree coordinates from the database as well, but for the last HTML file I just left it reading 5 random locations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Hendrix" /><category term="Arboretum" /><summary type="html">The Hendrix Arboretum is a project I have been working on for a while.

I’ve never really used these for personal journaling, but I guess I might as well, I mean its my blog right. I’ve just got a lot on my mind and right now I feel like anyone who is willing to listen to me just ends up becoming sad by listening to me. I’m just gonna try not to worry about how I make other people feel for a while. Long story short, I got broken up with. I wont go super in depth cause its the internet. But for a while I was really happy, I don’t think I’ve ever been so consistently happy in my life. We were only dating for a month but I feel like saying that undermines what I went through. To most people a month is not that long, and I guess it really isn’t, but to me it felt like so much longer. I guess I never really realized how self conscious and anxious I am. I feel like I put a lot of strain on my partner because of that, always searching for validation and reassurance can take a toll on someone. But she just always seemed so much more confident and calm about everything it made me think it didn’t affect her. IDK it made me feel silly and stupid to just be happy at the thought making someone else happy, but it was genuine. It made me inexplicably happy to be wanted by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I get a lot of enjoyment from helping others. I don’t have much going on very often, so it is very comforting to me to feel useful in some way. It could be something stupid like helping someone switch internet networks so they can do mobile print. But I will think about how if I did nothing else I made someone’s day marginally better. It sucks to say, but it is very hard to do much of anything now. I have not been sleeping much, and I wish I was doing more because of that. Now I wake up so incredibly tired, and just lay there for a couple hours trying to get some more rest. I have been going to the gym a lot more at least. I feel like I have so much more time now, or I guess a better way to say it would be that life is moving slower. I have been trying to do things that make me happy rock climbing, skating, helping other people, and listening to new music. Nothing feels the same. I know that is to be expected for a while, but I just wish I didn’t feel so bad for myself. I feel like there’s more I could have done, and more I still want to do. I know I should not worry about that. I am going to keep doing things and try to start thinking about them less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been uploading to github everyday for about 3 months. I think the day I got broken up with I remembered that I had forgotten, and I still did not care. Idk it is already Wednesday and the entire weekend is a blur. I had been uploading old class projects, and even notes and granted I was working on several other projects, mostly still for school while I was uploading all this old stuff. But I still felt fake about what I was doing. I can’t get over the fact that so much of what I do is just googling and copy pasting, sometimes I feel like I don’t learn a lot from what I do. I was traveling through New York with my friends, or working another job most days, and I Just happened to have an old file around to upload. It felt productive for a while, but I don’t think it really was, I obsessively check my github, and once I upload a file I feel content, like I don’t need to do anything else that day. I guess that feeling is alright sometimes, I guess there is only so much you can do in a given day. But right now I don’t want to feel like I need to force myself to do anything, or hold my self to any rigid responsibility. I know it is ironic, that I am in fact uploading this blog to github too, but lets be honest nobody goes here. It just feels nice to have a log of progress. To do better for myself I think I am only going to upload to github when I feel I’ve actually completed a project. I might write a blog post from time to time if I take some cool pictures. I cannot say that I feel good, but I feel better today than I have in the past&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to try to take it easy on myself, I know that I need to work on myself, and it is going to take a lot of time. I have a lot of habits I feel it would good to break, and a lot of new skills I think it would be fun to learn. I am just going to take things one day at a time for a while and try not to work myself into another depressive state. If you made it this far through my sob story, thanks for listening :)

The opportunity to bring your clients ideas to life through the website is spectacular and provides a sense of fulfillment. The real takeaway is that every group in this class is building something that effectively helps the community in some way, whether that be educational through a nonprofit, etc. It is a well known fact that programmers stand to profit a lot in this day and age.

All it really took was installing ruby and a couple things through the command prompt. I did accidentally skip a step. This left me without some of the critical sections of this blog that make it function as a real website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time and assistance from my professor, I fixed my mistake and got this blog to its current state. If you plan on following in my footsteps I recommend that you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Read directions a few times over
*Double check to make sure your commands are executed
*Do A little bit of research about what you are installing
*Think Creatively, it can only get better from here&lt;/p&gt;
