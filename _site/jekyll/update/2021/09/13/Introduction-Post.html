    <p>Here we go the first official post on my blog. My experience in setting up this blog was fairly easy. I think it is so easy, practically anyone could do it given the right instructions and guidance. All it really took was installing ruby and a couple things through the command prompt. I did accidentally skip a step. This left me without some of the critical sections of this blog that make it function as a real website.</p>

<p>After some time and assistance from my professor, I fixed my mistake and got this blog to its current state. If you plan on following in my footsteps I recommend that you:</p>

<p>*Read directions a few times over
*Double check to make sure your commands are executed
*Do A little bit of research about what you are installing
*Think Creatively, it can only get better from here</p>

<p>And if you are so enthusiastic about making your first blog you cannot control yourself. You may follow the directions <a href="https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html">HERE</a>.</p>
