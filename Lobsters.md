Lobsters are pretty cool. Aside from being remarkably tasty, they also have some remarkable characteristics. Lobsters are biologically immortal, which means that they cannot die of old age. Lobsters can only die of natural causes or due to predators. Because of this fact, it is considerably difficult to determine the age of an lobster. These fascinating creatures were also served to prisoners in recent history. The crustacean was referred to as "The poor mans chicken" in colonial times. A very small percentage of lobsters are also born blue instead of their normal dark color. This is also true for most crustaceans, it is similar to the albino characteristics found in mammals.
